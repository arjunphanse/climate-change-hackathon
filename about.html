        <h2>Arjun</h2>
        <p>Hi, My name is Arjun. I am ten years old and a rising 6th grader. I created this team to compete in the hackathon by recruiting two of my friends because it had cool prizes and it would give me coding experience. My hobby is painting and I like playing tennis. I used JS to create my website along with css and html and used snap to create a flooding simulator.

        <h2>Hadi</h2>
        <p>Hello my name is Hadi and I really like squash. I also play soccer and basketball and I play brawl stars. I am going to Menlo school and I also like to bake. I have done a few fundraisers for charities.  I think that this is a great opportunity to learn how hackathons work. I have really enjoyed my experience.

        <h2>Riaan</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Riaan and I really enjoy playing Roblox, baseball and reading. I live in Palo Alto and I am going to 6th grade next year. I love playing with tech and coding and I am creating a Roblox game with my best friend. I chose to do this Hackathon because I thought it would be fun and a new opportunity that I might not get later on and I really enjoy making my game!
