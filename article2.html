        <h1> Iceberg Simulator</h1>
        <p class = "space">My project is a simulator about the polar ice caps, which are melting and causing sea levels to rise. You play it by using the arrow keys to move the meter bar around and you can see how different levels of heat affect the ice caps and the sea level. The code behind this is simple, it is just the meter bar being able to move and detect the color it is on, then broadcasting a message that says what color it is on and making the ice caps disappear or reappear and the sea level rise or drop based on that. This is related to climate change because it shows that if it gets too hot, ice caps will melt, which would make sea levels rise and animals such as polar bears go extinct. But, if the world gets too cold, then there would be less drinkable water. So, we need to keep the world at a good average temperature, not too hot and not too cold.
