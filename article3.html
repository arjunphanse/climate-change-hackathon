            My project helps climate change because you are trying to stop carbon emission cars. Your goal is trying to tap and many cars that release carbon, everytime you tap a car then you earn a point. If you press the car that does not have any smoke in the back then you lose a point. Your goal is to try to get the most points in 1 min.
