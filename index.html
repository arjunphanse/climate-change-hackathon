        <p>We want to spread awareness of climate change through this website. We explain the cause and effect of climate change and the various policies that can help remediate the effects of climate change. We have also made games and simulations to project the impact of climate change and the policies for addressing it.

        <br>
        Before the Industrial Revolution, over 200 years ago the Carbon Dioxide (Co2) in the atmosphere was 280 ppm (parts per million). What that means is that for every 1 million parts in the atmosphere there were 280 parts of Co2. Today, due to the effects of burning fossil fuel for creating energy since the industrial revolution, we have about 447 ppm of Co2 in the atmosphere. The Co2 in the atmosphere acts as a blanket absorbing heat and warming the earth. This is leading to the rise in atmospheric temperature which is causing the melting of polar ice caps. This is increasing the water in the seas and expanding it resulting in rising sea levels. The rising seas are leading to flooding of coastal cities dislocating thousand (and in the future, millions) of people and huge economic losses.

            Climate change can be addressed by reducing the future carbon emmissions and extracting the existing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Both approaches are necessary to prevent global warming and rising sea levels.
